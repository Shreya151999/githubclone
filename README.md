# githubclone
This is the github clone repository page of a user for Fyle Website Development Internship.
The assignment is only done in HTML, CSS and Javascript. Bootstrap and Jquery has also been used.

This is a simple dynamic website design that allows users to view GitHub repositories. The application provides information about a user's GitHub profile, including a profile picture, email, bio, location, and links to Twitter and GitHub. Users can search for repositories, view them, and navigate through paginated results.\
Features as required:
Display GitHub user profile information.
Displays the repositories and topics respectively, I have used an external API call to link sample github repositories and topics.
Dynamic pagination for repositories.
- By default, it shows`10` repositories per page
- User has the option to choose maximum of `100` repositories per page.
When the API calls are in progress, loaders have been implemented.
Also, tried to create a search filter option for repositories(it was an optional requirement)
